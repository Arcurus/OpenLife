**DISCLAIMER: Project is still in progress, and is not usable from a player perspective yet, stay tuned.**

To Developers:
=========
*Open Life is a [Haxe](https://haxe.org) based One Life engine.*

* **Open Api:**  Quickly search through the [api](https://pxshadow.github.io/OpenLife-Docs/api/index.html) and find variables and methods.

* **Real Time Console:** Exe code in real time using [hscript](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript) and eventually [cppia](https://haxe.org/manual/target-cppia-getting-started.html).

* **Scripting:** Allows programmers to easily build programs on top of the engine architecture.

* **High performance resource access:** Uses multi threading and object baking / skimming in order to make the boot up and dealing with the files very simple.


* **Cross compiled languages:** Compiles to [Java](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/java.html), [C#](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/csharp.html), [Python](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/python.html), [Lua](https://haxe.org/manual/target-lua-getting-started.html), [Php](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/php.html)

* **Thoughtful, concise and efficient code:** Codebase continues to become as minimalist as possible while also keeping the level of abstraction low.
