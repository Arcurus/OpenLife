Summary
======

*Open Life is a [Haxe](https://haxe.org) based OneLife engine. (early alpha state)*
* **Easy creation:** Build a client/bot (server in the future) easily for any OneLife server supported protocol (OneLife and TwoLife etc)

* **Open Api:**  Quickly search through the [api](https://pxshadow.github.io/OpenLife-Docs/api/index.html) and find variables and methods you need to create a new project.

* **Scripting:** Allows programmers to easily build programs on top of the engine architecture, using an event model. Can also be interpreted at runtime using the [hscript library](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript).

* **Easy to use build tools:** Unlike c++ the build tools are unified. A simple npm install will download the needed haxe language version, then download vscode download the haxe extension and Hashlink debugger and you can easily compile and debug the project :) (Currently will also need to manually setup Hashlink until it's integrated into lix)


* **Cross compiled languages:** Compiles to [Java](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/java.html), [C#](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/csharp.html), [Python](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/python.html), [Lua](https://haxe.org/manual/target-lua-getting-started.html), [Php](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/php.html), [Javascript/NodeJS](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/javascript.html)

* **Thoughtful, concise and efficient code:** Codebase is designed around ease of use and collaboration and continues to become as minimalis as possible while also keeping the level of abstraction low.
