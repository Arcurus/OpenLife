**DISCLAIMER: Project is still in progress, and is not usable from a player perspective yet, stay tuned.**

To Players:
=======

*Open Life is a fast, light weight [One Life](http://onehouronelife.com/) client/application.*

* Easy setup, and feature rich.

* Improvements such as in game settings and key bindings.

* Plug and play script support.

*  Quality of life improvements across the board.

* Dedicated development for a new, custom built client, independently supported.

To Developers:
=========
*Open Life is an [OpenFL](https://openfl.org) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org) based One Life client.*

* **Open Api:**  Quickly search through the [api](https://pxshadow.github.io/OpenLife-Docs/api/index.html) and find variables and methods.

* **Real Time Console:** Exe code in real time using [hscript](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript) and eventually [cppia](https://haxe.org/manual/target-cppia-getting-started.html).

* **Client Scripting:** Allows programmers to easily build programs on type of the client architecture.

* **High performance Rendering:** Uses a powerful display list system called Tilemap ([Demo](https://www.openfl.org/samples/bunny/)) to display all chunks, floors and sprites.

* **Cross platform:** Deploy to a [plethora of targets](https://github.com/openfl/lime#targets) with the stability of OpenFL.

* **Cross compilied languages:** Compiles to [Java](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/java.html), [C#](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/csharp.html), [Python](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/python.html), [Lua](https://haxe.org/manual/target-lua-getting-started.html), [Php](https://haxe.org/documentation/platforms/php.html)

* **Thoughtful, concise and efficent code:** Codebase continues to become as minimalistic as possible while also keeping the level of abstraction low.
