Animations
xOscPerSec= move left and right over the x-axis (speed)
xAmp = distance moved
xPhase = where to start animation
children inherent parents animations
rock is a rocking animation rotation back and fourth
offsets go back and fourth

X Osc = how often, in cycles
X Amp = how far it swings, swings forward than backwards
X Phase = from what point of the whole swing cycle it should start.
